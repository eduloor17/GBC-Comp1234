        As I started creating links to my folder structure and files, I found it easy to create folders and files in my HTML public directory on my computer. However, I encountered some problems when I tested some links, such as the common 404 Not Found error in the localhost. But instead of getting discouraged, I decided to investigate the issue and find the root cause of the problem. I made sure that the path to the folder was correct in WebStorm, and I tried many times in different browsers to open the folder, but the problem persisted. Despite the challenges, I remained persistent and opened up one file inside the broken link folder, and the link worked fine. I then decided to upload everything with the FTP app to my server, and to my delight, I did not encounter the same error that I had before in the localhost. This experience taught me the importance of paying attention to every character and organizing the code into sections with comments to remember what I made or for others who want to modify the HTML document in the future. I also learned the difference between relative and absolute references and sought clarification from GBC mobihelp. I am determined to become an excellent web developer, and challenges in my next assignments and labs are what I look forward to. I am confident that with my attention to detail and dedication to learning, I will become an experienced professional in this competitive IT network. Thank you for reading!
